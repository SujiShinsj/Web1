    <H2>About me</H2>
    <p>Hi, My name is <strong>Suji Shin</strong>. I'm a <strong><u>UX Designer</u></strong>. Based on my major in <strong>interior architecture</strong>, I know how to understand the users and help them have a great experience while they are using the services.</p>
    <img src="ME.jpg" width="100%">
    <p style="margin-top:40px">I've graduated from <a href="http://www.hongik.ac.kr/index.do" target="_blank" title="Hongik University">Hongik University</a>, where I was majoring in Interior Architecture. Designing space is about understanding the people who will be in that space. I think designing data is not different from it.</p>
